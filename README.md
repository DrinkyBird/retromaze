                          Retromaze is... well, the result of putting retro
                          games and Jumpmaze in a blender. Especially if
                          said blender is on.
                          It's basically the continuation of Retro JumpMaze
                          / JumpMaze 3 by Doomfiend. It contains updated
                          maps from JumpMaze 3 and soon, there'll be some
                          original ones too.
                          RetroMaze is led by FateLord and me. FateLord was
                          given permission by Doomfiend to continue
                          JumpMaze 3.
